The Android edition of the [Live UV app](/projects/live-uv) is now available on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chrisflemming.liveuv). 

In summer in Australia, the UV levels are extreme in the middle of the day in most of the country. This is the app you need! Remember to use sun protection whenever you are outdoors and the UV index is 3 or above.

A huge thanks to everyone who helped test the Android version.
