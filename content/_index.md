I am a software engineer and engineering manager based in Canberra, Australia.

Software engineering is a team sport. I'm hugely passionate about both the technical side and the human side of the discipline.

In my spare time I enjoy taking photos, particularly of the fantastic birdlife we have in Australia. I also enjoy backcountry hiking and camping, baking bread, and playing with drones.

Get in touch! I'd love to hear from you.
