I am a software engineer and engineering manager based in Canberra, Australia.

Software engineering is a team sport. I'm equally passionate about geeking out over tech, and collaborating with and mentoring others.

In my spare time I enjoy taking photos, particularly of the fantastic birdlife we have in Australia. I also enjoy backcountry hiking and camping, baking bread, and playing with FPV drones.
