In Australia we have the highest rate of skin cancer in the world. The sun, especially in summer, has an intensity that many people from the Northern Hemisphere would never have experienced. 

I have seen many older relatives require treatment for skin cancer. Sun safety is drilled into kids from a young age - the [Slip Slop Slap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7nocIenCYg) and [Me No Fry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsgdT8YYwJo) health campaigns are fond memories from my childhood.

On the other hand, during the colder months in Canberra I can struggle to get much sun exposure. I find this can negatively impact my mood and energy levels, and I need to make an effort to get outside in the sun during these times.

The Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA) have a fantastic [website](https://www.arpansa.gov.au/our-services/monitoring/ultraviolet-radiation-monitoring/ultraviolet-radiation-index) that you can use to see live UV measurements for Australian captial cities and selected other locations. This data is far more accurate than that provided by other weather apps that only provide estimates.

I wanted an easy way to refer to ARPANSA's data while on the go so I've written Live UV. This is a simple mobile application developed using React Native which will give you the latest UV index reading for the selected location. You can use this app to determine when it is safe to be outside in the sun. I hope you find it useful.

The code is open source, check out the [github repository](https://github.com/chrisflemming/LiveUVApp) if you're interested.
