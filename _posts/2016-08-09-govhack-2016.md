title: GovHack 2016
---

Last month I competed in [GovHack](https://www.govhack.org/) 2016 which was held on July 29-31. I was part of team #FF0000 which comprised myself and my Oracle colleagues Joel Nation, James Ryles and Damien McAullay. Our project was [Ausémon](http://ausemon.io/) - a Pokémon Go style augmented reality game which utilises open data from the [ACT Government](https://www.data.act.gov.au/) and the [Atlas of Living Australia](http://www.ala.org.au). It was a great event - we all had a lot of fun and learned a lot in process. Check out the [project video](https://vimeo.com/176903634).
