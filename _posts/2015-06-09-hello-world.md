This is a blog for my tech side projects and other bits and pieces. It is running on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) using [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole), a flavour of [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll). Thanks to Joshua Lande for his excellent [post](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/) on how to get this set up.
